On April 29, 1961, ABC debuted Wide World of Sports, an anthology series created by Edgar Scherick through his company Sports Programs, Inc. and produced by a young Roone Arledge which featured a different sporting event each broadcast. ABC purchased Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as the executive producer of that division's shows. Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events."}], "title": "Title_50"}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who designed The Forest tapestry in the V&A collection from the same period?", "answers": [{"text": "William Morris", "answer_start": 217}, {"text": "William Morris", "answer_start": 217}, {"text": "William Morris", "answer_start": 217}], "id": "1005651"}], "context": "One of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection.
